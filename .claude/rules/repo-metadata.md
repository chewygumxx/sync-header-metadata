# `.repo-metadata.jsonc` is the GitHub settings page

This file holds the GitHub repository's own description, topics and licence. CI
applies it on every push to `main`, so those settings are edited here and not in
the web interface.

Editing them in the web interface is the failure worth naming: nothing rejects
it, and the next push silently reverts it.
